# GitHub Pages frontend for a Cloudflare Worker ChatGPT agent

1) Create a Cloudflare Worker for the API (see the Worker code I provide in chat).
2) Replace the `API` constant in `index.html` with your Worker URL (e.g., https://name.workers.dev/api/chat).
3) Upload this `index.html` to a GitHub repo and enable **Settings â†’ Pages** (branch: `main`, folder: `/root`).
4) Open your GitHub Pages URL and chat away.
